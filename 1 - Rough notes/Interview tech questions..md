Hi Sir, 

I hope this email finds you well. As requested during our recent interview, I have completed the technical task you assigned. I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my skills and problem-solving abilities.


Please find attached a Word document containing my solutions to the following problems:

1. Reverse a String
2. Find the Largest Element in an Array
3. FizzBuzz
4. Factorial of a Number
5. Check Prime Number
6. Find the Second Largest Element

I have provided detailed implementations for each task, including comments to explain my approach where necessary. 
For each problem, I have created a playground link where you can view and run the code directly. These links are included in the attached Word document

I look forward to your feedback and the next steps in the interview process.
s,
Anthony
Best regard
