   Here's a classic Chicken Tikka recipe for you to try at home. This dish is a popular Indian appetizer made with marinated chicken pieces cooked until perfectly tender and flavorful.

### Ingredients

#### For the Marinade:

- 500 grams boneless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 cup plain yogurt
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon ginger paste
- 1 tablespoon garlic paste
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1 teaspoon garam masala
- 1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
- 1 teaspoon paprika (for color)
- 1 teaspoon salt

#### For Cooking:

- Skewers (if using wooden skewers, soak them in water for at least 30 minutes)
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil or melted butter (for basting)

#### For Garnish:

- Lemon wedges
- Fresh cilantro, chopped
- Sliced onions

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Marinade:**
    
    - In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, lemon juice, ginger paste, garlic paste, vegetable oil, ground cumin, ground coriander, ground turmeric, garam masala, red chili powder, paprika, and salt. Mix well to form a smooth marinade.
2. **Marinate the Chicken:**
    
    - Add the chicken pieces to the marinade and coat them evenly. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight for the best flavor.
3. **Preheat the Grill/Oven:**
    
    - Preheat your grill to medium-high heat or preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
4. **Skewer the Chicken:**
    
    - Thread the marinated chicken pieces onto the skewers, leaving a little space between each piece to ensure even cooking.
5. **Grill/Bake the Chicken:**
    
    - **Grilling:** Place the skewers on the grill and cook for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally and basting with oil or melted butter until the chicken is cooked through and has a nice char.
    - **Baking:** Place the skewers on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, turning once halfway through, until the chicken is cooked and slightly charred.
6. **Garnish and Serve:**
    
    - Remove the chicken tikka from the skewers and transfer to a serving plate. Garnish with lemon wedges, chopped cilantro, and sliced onions.

### Tips

- **Yogurt:** Using thick Greek yogurt can help the marinade stick better to the chicken.
- **Marination Time:** The longer you marinate the chicken, the more flavorful and tender it will be.
- **Cooking:** Make sure the chicken is cooked through but not overcooked to avoid dryness.
- **Serving:** Chicken tikka can be served with naan, rice, or as an appetizer with green chutney.

Enjoy your delicious homemade Chicken Tikka!
