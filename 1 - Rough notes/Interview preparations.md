**How do you manage state in a React application?**
- **Answer:** State can be managed using `useState` for functional components or `this.state` in class components. For global state management, we can use `Redux` or `Context API`.
- 
**What are Hooks, and how do they benefit functional components?**
- **Answer:** Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Common hooks include `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`. They simplify code and avoid the need for class components.

**Explain how React Router works.**
- **Answer:** React Router is a library for routing in React applications. It allows navigation between different components/views using URL paths. Components like `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, `Link`, and `Switch` are used to define routes and handle navigation.

**How do you integrate a RESTful API in a React application?**
- **Answer:** You can use `fetch` or libraries like `axios` to make HTTP requests to a RESTful API. Use `useEffect` to fetch data when the component mounts and store the data in state using `useState`.
- 
**What is Redux, and why would you use it?**
- **Answer:** Redux is a state management library that helps manage the application state in a predictable way. It is used for larger applications where state needs to be shared across multiple components. It uses a single source of truth (store) and actions to update the state.

### DevOps

#### Key Areas:

1. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
3. **Containerization and Orchestration**
4. **Monitoring and Logging**

#### Common Questions and Answers:

1. **What is Continuous Integration, and why is it important?**
    - **Answer:** Continuous Integration (CI) is a practice where developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository. Automated tests are run to ensure code quality. CI helps catch issues early and improves collaboration.
    - 
1. **Explain the concept of Continuous Deployment.**
    - **Answer:** Continuous Deployment (CD) is the practice of automatically deploying every code change to production, provided it passes all tests. It ensures faster release cycles and more reliable software delivery.
    - 
1. **What tools have you used for CI/CD?**
    - **Answer:** Common tools include Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitHub Actions. These tools automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
    - 
1. **What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?**
    - **Answer:** IaC is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes. Tools like Terraform and AWS CloudFormation enable this practice, making infrastructure reproducible and version-controlled.
    - 
1. **How do containers and orchestration tools like Kubernetes fit into DevOps?**
    - **Answer:** Containers package applications with their dependencies, ensuring consistency across environments. Orchestration tools like Kubernetes manage containerized applications, providing scalability, load balancing, and automated deployment.
    - 
1. **How do you handle monitoring and logging in a production environment?**
    - **Answer:** Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), and Splunk are used for monitoring and logging. They help track application performance and diagnose issues.
