Improving your coding skills more efficiently is a great goal. Here are some strategies to help you learn faster without relying solely on long YouTube videos:

1. Practice actively:
    - Spend more time writing code than watching videos.
    - Try to implement what you learn immediately after watching a video.
2. Project-based learning:
    - Work on small projects that interest you.
    - Gradually increase project complexity as you improve.
4. Read documentation:
    - Official documentation is often more concise and comprehensive than videos.
5. Use shorter, focused tutorials:
    - Look for quick tip videos or articles instead of long courses.
6. Join coding communities:
    - Participate in forums like Stack Overflow or Reddit's programming communities.
    - Explain concepts to others to reinforce your understanding.
8. Set specific learning goals:
    - Focus on one concept or technology at a time.
9. Use spaced repetition:
    - Revisit concepts regularly to reinforce your learning.
11. Build a learning routine:
    - Consistent, shorter practice sessions are often more effective than long, infrequent ones.
12. Use diverse resources:
    - Combine videos with books, articles, and interactive tutorials.

Remember, the key is active engagement with the material. Try to apply what you learn as soon as possible, and don't be afraid to experiment and make mistakes. That's often where the most learning happens.
