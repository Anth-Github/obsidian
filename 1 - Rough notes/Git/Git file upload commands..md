2. **Navigate to the Repository Directory**
    
    sh
    
    Copy code
    
    `cd yourrepository`
    
    Replace `yourrepository` with the name of your repository directory.
    
3. **Check the Status of Your Repository**
    
    sh
    
    Copy code
    
    `git status`
    
    This command shows the status of changes in your working directory.
    
4. **Stage the Changes**
    
    - To stage all changes:

6. **Push the Changes to GitHub**
    
    sh
    
    Copy code
    
    `git push origin main`
    
    Replace `main` with the name of your branch if it’s different (e.g., `master`).
    

### Example Commands

Here’s a full example workflow:

sh

 ```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git

# Navigate to the repository directory
cd yourrepository

# Check the status of your repository
git status

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit the changes with a message
git commit -m "Updated files with new changes"

# Push the changes to the main branch on GitHub
git push origin main


### Notes:

- Make sure you replace placeholders (e.g., `yourusername`, `yourrepository`, `main`) with your actual GitHub username, repository name, and branch name.
- If you encounter authentication prompts, ensure your credentials or SSH keys are correctly set up.
- If you need to pull the latest changes from the remote repository before pushing, use `git pull origin main` before `git push`.
