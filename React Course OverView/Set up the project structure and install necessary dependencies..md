  
Here are the detailed steps for Task 1: Set up the project structure and install necessary dependencies:

Step 3.1: Create a new React project

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.  
Run the command npx create-react-app todo-list-app (replace "todo-list-app" with your desired app name).  
This will create a new React project with the basic file structure and dependencies.

Step 3.2: Install necessary dependencies

In the project directory, run the command npm install or yarn install to install the dependencies listed in the package.json file.  
Install the following additional dependencies:  
npm install react-router-dom for client-side routing.  
npm install redux react-redux for state management.  
npm install moment for date and time formatting.  
npm install web-notifications for reminders.

Step 3.3: Set up the project structure

Create the following directories and files:  
src/components for React components.  
src/actions for Redux actions.  
src/reducers for Redux reducers.  
src/constants for constant values.  
src/utils for utility functions.  
src/App.js for the main application component.  
src/index.js for the entry point of the application.  
Move the App.css file to the src/components directory.

Step 3.4: Configure the project

In the package.json file, add the following scripts:  
"start": "react-scripts start"  
"build": "react-scripts build"  
"test": "react-scripts test"  
In the src/index.js file, add the following code to enable Redux and React Router:  
import React from 'react';  
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';  
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';  
import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';  
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';  
import App from './App';

const store = createStore(combineReducers({}));

ReactDOM.render(  
<Provider store={store}>  
<BrowserRouter>  
<App />  
</BrowserRouter>  
</Provider>,  
document.getElementById('root')  
);

Step 3.5: Verify the project setup

Run the command npm start or yarn start to start the development server.  
Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to verify that the project is set up correctly.
