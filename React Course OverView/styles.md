In a Next.js application, the styles folder is where you typically place your CSS files. Next.js uses a [[CSS-in-JS approach]], which allows you to write CSS styles alongside your JavaScript components.

Here are some key features of the styles folder in Next.js:

1. CSS Modules: Next.js supports CSS Modules, which allows you to write scoped CSS that only applies to the component it's imported in.
2. Global Styles: You can also write global styles that apply to the entire application by placing a global.css file in the styles folder.
3. Component-specific Styles: You can write styles specific to a component by creating a CSS file with the same name as the component, e.g., Home.module.css for the Home component.
4. Sass/SCSS Support: Next.js supports Sass/SCSS out of the box, allowing you to write styles using these preprocessors.
5. Automatic Import: Next.js automatically imports CSS files when you use the import statement, making it easy to manage your styles.

By default, Next.js looks for CSS files in the styles folder, but you can customize this behavior by configuring the css option in your next.config.js file.

Here's an example of how you might structure your styles folder:

styles/
global.css
Home.module.css
components/
Button.module.css
Header.module.css
...

In this example, global.css contains global styles, while Home.module.css contains styles specific to the Home component. The components folder contains styles for individual components, like Button and Header.
