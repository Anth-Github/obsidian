In Next.js, the styles folder is a special directory where you can store your CSS files. Here are some key things to know about the styles folder:

1. Global styles: Any CSS file you put in the styles folder will be automatically applied globally to your entire application.
2. CSS Modules: Next.js supports CSS Modules out of the box. This means you can write CSS specific to a component in a file with the same name as the component, and it will be scoped to that component only.
3. Preprocessing: Next.js supports CSS preprocessing using Sass, Less, or PostCSS. You can use these tools to write more efficient and modular CSS.
4. No need for import: You don't need to import your CSS files in your components. Next.js will automatically include them in your application.
5. Order matters: The order of your CSS files in the styles folder matters. Next.js will include them in the order they are listed in the folder.

Some common use cases for the styles folder include:

- Global CSS resets or normalization
- Component-specific CSS
- Theme-related CSS
- Utility classes

By using the styles folder, you can keep your CSS organized and easily maintainable, while also leveraging Next.js's built-in features for efficient and modular styling.
