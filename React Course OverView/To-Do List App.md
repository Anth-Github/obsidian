Create a simple to-do list app with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
    
- Implement features like task prioritization, due dates, and reminders



Step 1: Understand the Problem

The problem is to create a simple to-do list app that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. The app should also have features like task prioritization, due dates, and reminders.

Step 2: Analyze the Codebase

Since this is a new project, there is no existing codebase to analyze. We will start from scratch and use React as the front-end framework.

Step 3: Break Down the Problem

Task 1: [[Set up the project structure and install necessary dependencies.]] 
Task 2: Create the user interface for the to-do list app.  
Task 3: Implement CRUD operations for tasks.  
Task 4: Implement task prioritization feature.  
Task 5: Implement due dates feature.  
Task 6: Implement reminders feature.  
		Task 7: Test and debug the app.  
Task 8: Deploy the app.

Step 4: Research and Gather Information

Research React best practices for building to-do list apps. Gather information on how to implement CRUD operations in React. Research libraries and APIs for implementing reminders (e.g., Web Notifications API).

Step 5: Implement Solutions

Write clean, modular, and well-documented code for each task. Use React best practices and follow the project's coding standards. Implement tasks one by one, testing and verifying each step.

Step 6: Test and Debug

Write unit tests and integration tests for new code. Use debugging tools (e.g., React DevTools, Chrome DevTools). Test the application thoroughly, including edge cases.

Step 7: Review and Refactor

Review the code for quality, performance, and maintainability. Refactor code to improve structure, readability, and efficiency. Ensure code consistency and adherence to project standards.

Step 8: Deploy and Monitor

Deploy the updated application to the designated environment (e.g., Netlify, Vercel). Monitor the application's performance, errors, and user feedback. Make adjustments and fixes as needed.
